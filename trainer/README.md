# Wanwan Puppy Trainer

[Run in your browser here!](https://wan.loopy.land/)

A browser-based save trainer for [わんわん愛情物語](http://femicom.org/collection/item/wanwan-aijou-monogatari/) (Wanwan Aijou Monogatari, or "Puppy Love Story") for Casio Loopy.
Enables you to enter names in kanji or romaji, when the game only allows for kana entry.
Generates cleared save slots, which allow you to resume play from any chapter, and access all the stickers!

You can use this:
* with a Loopy emulator like [Loopy My Seal Emulator](https://github.com/PSI-Rockin/LoopyMSE) or [MAME 0.260+](https://github.com/mamedev/mame)
* on a Loopy [Flash Cart](https://github.com/partlyhuman/loopycart)
* by writing the save to a real game cart using [OSCR](https://github.com/sanni/cartreader)

Enjoy!
