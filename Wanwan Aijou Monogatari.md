D: Roger, were you a good girl today?

R: Papa! Roger isn't a LITTLE KID any more!

D: Haha, is that right? But... today is a special day, isn't it?

R: Papa, you remembered? Today is Roger's birthday!

D: Of course! Well! Your present is in this room. Do you wanna look for it?

R: Whaaa?! What could it be?

B: *Wan wan!*

R: Bagel! Bagel! Kawwwwaiii!

R: Such big ears! Hehe, looks like you could fly through the air.

R: Papa! THANK YOU!!

M: Roger. A puppy is a living thing, so you must cherish him and raise him well, you know.

M: You must not get tired of him or neglect him!

D: That's right, and you must train him well.

R: Train?

D: That's right. To start, it'd be best to teach him "sit".

R: How do we do that?

D: Papa will show you, so watch closely.

D: Okay, Roger? So, tap here, on bagel's back... and say "Sit!"

D: Bagel...

D: Sit!

D: Bagel, Bagel!

D: Sit! Bagel, sit!

D: Good! Good! You're a very smart boy, Bagel! You get it now?

B: *Wan wan!*

D: Gooood! Good boy, good boy!

D: So, Roger. Please try it like Papa showed you.

R: Okay!

- 👉Teach "sit"

R: Bagel!

R: Sit!

R: Bagel, sit!

B: .....

R: Bagel! Sit!

B: ??? *Wan wan!*

R: Papaaaa.... Bagel won't sit...

D: Don't give up, Roger. Try one more time.

R: OK.

B: *Wan wan!*

R: Papa, BAGEL learned SIT!

D: Goooood! Well! Next, bring him here!

D: Watch closely how Papa does this.

D: Bagel!

B: *Wan!*

D: Bagel. See the ball over there?

B: *Wan wan!*

D: Roger, teach Bagel with one of these balls.

R: OK!

R: Bagel!

R: Over here! The ball's over here!

D: Bagel, over there. There's the ball.

B: *Wan!*

B: *Wan!*

R: Good, Bagel! Good boy, good boy!

B: *Wan wan!*

R: Bagel, ball! That ball! Bring me that ball!

B: *Wan!*

R: Bagel.....

- 👉Teach "fetch" 
- Quit teaching

R: Bagel, ball! Bring me the ball!

B: *sniff sniff*

R: No, Bagel....

- 👉Teach "fetch" 
- Quit teaching

R: Bagel! Go get the ball! Please!

B: *Yawn*

- 👉Teach "fetch" 
- Quit teaching

R: .....BAGEL!! BALL! GET THE BALL!

B: *whimper*

D: Roger... Roger, you're getting a little frustrated, aren't you?

R: ?!

D: Bagel has a heart, you know. Since Bagel won't do what you want, you got a little frustrated, right? Bagel is very sensitive. He can understand your body language... and he won't come to you if you're irritated.

M: Right. So if Bagel fetches even once, maybe you should lavish him with praise! That would make him happy, very happy. If you do that, Bagel might bring you the ball to get that praise again!

R: Ohhhh..... OK, I got it! I won't get frustrated! I'll praise him a bunch!... Right?

R: Let's try it!

- 👉Teach "fetch" 
- Quit teaching

R: Bagel. Bring me the ball! Ball. The ball!

B: *Wan wan!*

- 👉Teach "fetch" 
- Quit teaching

B: *Wan!*

R: Look, Bagel. Over there. Bring me that ball.

R: *Wan?*

R: Yes! Bring that ball!

R: *hehe*

R: Nooo, Bagel. Hm, he doesn't get it...

R: Look, Bagel. There. That ball.

B: *Wan wan! Wan wan!*

R: .....!!

B: *almoooost*

D: Look, Bagel! Over to Roger!

R: Bagel, bring me that ball like a good boy! Bagel!

B: *Wan!*

R: Bagel! Bring it. Bring it here!

B: *Fetches like a champ*

R: Bagel..... YOU DID IT! YOU FETCHED!

R: Bagel! Wonderful! Wonderful! Bagel is a very good boy!

R: Papa, Mama, Bagel finally learned how to fetch!

M: Yes, very good, Roger!

D: I think Bagel might have understood your heart, Roger.

B: *Wan wan!*

M: Sleep is very important for a puppy, isn't it? It would be very very bad for him to get sick. So! Let's put him to bed, shall we?

R: Haaaai.

D: Tomorrow you can play with the ball, Roger.

R: That's right! Good night, Bagel!

## At home

D: So, since today is Sunday, wouldn't it be nice to go play ball with bagel in the park!

R: Yeah! Let's go! Bagel!!

B: *Wan! Wan!*

R: Be back sooooon!

M: Take care!

# Chapter 2

## At the park

R: Good, Bagel! Can you fetch this? Here we go!

- 👉Throw gently
- Throw hard

R: There!

R: Bagel, amazing! You learned how to fetch perfectly!

R: Here comes one more!

- Throw gently
- 👉Throw hard

R: There!

B: *Epic jump catch*

R: Awesome, Bagel! How come you can do that, I never taught you?!

R: Here comes one more!

- Throw gently
- 👉Throw hard

R: Okaaay, this next one is kinda hard, can you do it?

R: Okay, here we go, Bagel! THERE!

B: *Jumps into bush*

R: Bagellll, you there?

R: ....Bagellll

R: Bagel, Bagel! Come! Come back!

R: Bagellll. (While calling out Bagel's name, I felt hungry all of a sudden...)

R: Bagellll.... What happened....

B: *Jumps out with a definitely not creepy doll*

R: BAGEL!

R: What were you doinnng? I was worrrieedd!

R: Wh, what's that? You picked up something other than the ball...

B: *Wan!*

R: That... That doll, where do I...?

R: Oh... Long ago, when we had to move here...

R: Umm, hmmm...

R: It was really important, so why can't I remember...

R: Judy... That's it! This is Judy!!!

B: *Wan wan!*

J: *JUMPS TO LIFE TERRIFYINGLY*

J: YOU REMEMBERED ME, ROGER-CHAN!!!

R: Eh? Eh?? EEHHHH???

J: Roger-chan! Rogerland... it's-

J: Quick, quick! It's important... it's precious...

C: *A mustachioed alarm clock jumps out of the bush, because why not*

C: Aaahhhhhh, aaah, ahem! Greetings!

R: W-wh-why!?? This.... alarm clock... is... moving?!

J: Shut up!! As I was saying, ROGERLAND IS PRECIOUS!

J: Therefore, Roger-chan, you have to come with me... to Rogerland!

R: Eh? EEEEEHHH?? What are you saying?!

R: I don't understand!

C: Ahem! Ahem!

C: As a subject of Rogerland, you are acting most deplorable, Judy.

C: As the caretaker of the Door of Time, I must beg your forgiveness for coming to the World of Reality at my own regrettable pace.

C: Yes, I have returned, I have returned!

J: Ugh, I have to put up with this? Will you be quiet, old man!?

C: Hmf...

C: Ahem! You may call me Clock!

C: As I was saying, I am the keeper of the Door of Time, that connects Rogerland and the World of Reality.

C: By the way, Roger-chan, it is almost time to go to JUKU.

J: Ugh! Enough about Juku, who cares!

J: Please, Roger-chan, there's no time. Look at this!

R: That's... Whose photo album is that?

R: .....That's my album!

R: How? Why?!

*A photo straight up disappears as you watch*

R: EEEH? The photo, it.... vanished!

J: Do you see why Rogerland is precious now?

J: If things keep going this way, Roger-chan's memories will ALL BE GONE!

J: If I was just a little bit later, even your memory of me might have died...

C: Judy, the closing of the Door of Time will soon be upon us! Let us return!

J: Please, Roger-chan! Please don't forget about me!

J: Let's stay friends forever, please...

R: Of- Of course we're friends, Judy!

R: But, WHERE IS ROGERLAND?

R: So I have to go to "Juku"...?

C: It's time, Judy! In 20 seconds... 19...

R: But I still have questions! ...And if I'm late for dinner, Papa will scold me...

C: 15... 14... 13...

R: Umm.... l.. look, even if we were to go to Rogerland, don't we need to prepare?

R: You know, like, things we need to bring, and... making arrangements...

C: 10... Judy, there's no time!

C: 8... Do you want to be stuck here!? 7...

J: Roger-chan! It's like I said... so... let's go!

J: I can explain better after we get there!

R: Eeehh! That... Judy!!!

*Everyone jumps back into the bushes*

R: Mr. Clock!

B: *Wan!* *Jumps in the bushes*

R: Ah... Bagel! Oh... wait for meeeeeeeeee!

## Forest

Voice: Roger...

Voice: Roger-chan...

R: *Waking up* Mama? What time is it?

B: *lick*

R: Kya! Bagel... Where am i?

C: Roger-chan, this is Rogerland.

R: Mr. Clock... Judy...!

R: We really came to... the land of memories...

J: Is Roger-chan going to be okay?

C: As we were not able to get to Juku in time, we are in a predicament...

J: Of course we're in a "predicament"!

C: Not "of course", Judy. Carelessly allowing the time to become so late is a serious affair!

J: UGHHH! To begin with, won't you shut up with your "time", "time", "time"!

J: Don't tell me you've never been just a teeny, tiny, little bit late yourself!

C: Never.

C: I have periodic maintenance once every two months, without fail. Therefore, I am never late, not even a single second.

R: ... I guess we're here now... We gotta do what we gotta do...

R: So, Judy, what should I do here?

J: To tell the truth, lately in Rogerland, the Veggies have been stirring up a rebellion. It's like, a big pain for everyone!

J: Even Judy's favorite ribbon was taken...

J: The disappearance of Roger-chan's memories is also their doing.

R: But why would... vegetables... do that kind of thing?

*Cue dramatic music*

J: It's the "Dark Lord Cabbage"! He's their super evil leader!

J: He's the one ordering the Veggies around.

R: Dark Lord Cabbage?

J: The way I heard it, Dark Lord Cabbage is gradually eating your memories...

J: Roger-chan, it seemed like even your memories of me would be forgotten!!!

R: Dark Lord Cabbage...

R: So unless I defeat him, my precious memories will vanish, huh?

C: Ahem. Roger-chan. It seems we have dragged you along and gotten you involved in this turmoil, but as a citizen of the World of Reality, walking about Rogerland is simply unacceptable.

C: So! I have made arrangements for your return.

R: Eh! I can return?

C: Naturally, as long as you are together with I, the Keeper of the Door of Time, you may any time open the door and return home. So let us return!

J: Mr. Clock, don't you know this is a serious affair?!

C: Silence!

C: Her presence is strictly prohibited by the 11th article of the Principles of Door Management!

J: Why you! This Rogerland we're in is the world of Roger's memories, you know.

C: So, what are you saying?

J: You don't get it yet? All that tick-tocking must have made your head go stupid.

J: If this keeps going, and all Roger-chan's memories are taken away; if she turns into an adult with no memories of her childhood, the World of Reality and the World of Memories will be completely severed and set adrift!

J: If that happens, you're out of a job! The Door of Time becomes totally obsolete!

J: And if nobody needs the Door of Time, nobody needs the *Janitor* of the Door of Time, do they now?!

C: Wh- What? Me, become useless?

C: That IS a serious affair. I see no helping it, I shall grant you special permission.

C: However, I shall accompany you, performing the duty of official overseer.

C: Well then, let us briskly and without sluggishness return these memories.

R: But... how?

B: *Wan wan!*

C: UWAAAAAAAAAAAAH! DOG!! THERE!!! REMAIN CALM!

R: Bagel, what is it?

R: Could Bagel have found something that could be a clue?

J: If so, he may be small, but he's certainly a very helpful dog!

R: Bagel, it's all you!

B: *Wan wan!*

## Tree

R: Huff huff... Bagel.... huff... is there something... huff... about this tree?

B: *Wan wan!*

Voice: Ahhhhh, help meee!

R: Was that someone's... voice?

J: That voice...

E: Someone helllp meeee!

E: Ahhh, won't someone return my ear-mon!

R: But it's familiar... Ummm, umm, a bear...

J: Roger-chan, you can do it! Think back!

R: Errr... That's right! Earb the bear!! It's Earb!

P: Cyu cyuke, what's dis, you some kinda official friend of dat bear?

R: I am! We are friends!

J: You cucumbers all are just minions of the Dark Lord Cabbage, aren't you?

J: Stop picking on defenseless people!

P: Cyu-cyu-cyuke. Well, what are you gonna do about it, hmm?

P: Youse! You wanna start something with me, Cyukeman??!

P: I'll scrub your cucumberbumps clean off yas!

B: *Jumps into hole in tree* 

B: *Emerges from another hole*

C: Ah, Bagel! I see, the holes must be connected.

P: O-ho! Mr. pup's come out to play, cuke.

B: *grrr, wan!*

P: Oi, Mr. pup. One thing about us cukes is we loooooooooooove riddles-cuke.

P: IF you can answer our riddles, we'll letcha go on your way-cuke!

P: Think you can answer 'em, Mr. pup?!

R: Eeeeeeeh!


Shall we go over the rules?

* 👉Yes! explain
* I know, I'm good

Roger-chan. Since Bagel can't really be expected to know riddles, you'll give him the answers. The rules are: after Cyukeman's riddle, three choices appear. Use the arrow buttons to choose the right one, and the A button to answer.

*Example plays out*

R: Bagel, number two!

B: *barks twice!*

Think carefully before you answer, Roger-chan.

B: *wan!*

R: Earb might be a little bit of a crybaby, but he's a very, very sweet bear.

R: When I was a little girl, I was afraid of thunder, and I'd cling to Earb.

R: Ever since then, Earb has always been by my side, absorbing all my fears.

R: How could anyone bully such a sweet bear?

E: I, I dunno-mon.

E: I was just playing at home when the Dark Lord Cabbage and his Cyukemon came...

E: *sniffle* My ear... they... tore it up-mon...

J: That's horrible!!

R: So, you were waiting all this time for us to come?

E: That's right-mon.

E: Even though I'm afraid of heights, I had to wait it out up in that tree-mon.

J: Ah! Wait, is that... possibly... a doghouse?

R: I, I recognize that! That's... that's... that's right!

R: Captain! Captain's doghouse!

R: Bagel, when I was little, looong before you came to our house, a dog named Captain lived with us.

R: He was also much, muuuch bigger than you.

R: Earb, is Captain in this world too!?

C: All too common an occurrence among young children, I am afraid. Regrettable, regrettable...

R: But flying with Roger-1... even though it was important to me...

R: Earb, where is Roger Unit 01?

E: Since this is the land of memories, Roger-01 should be in that place you remember: "Kindergarten"-mon. Unfortunately, since Kindergarten was claimed by the Potato Bonbons as part of their territory, they may have made it into farmland-mon.
