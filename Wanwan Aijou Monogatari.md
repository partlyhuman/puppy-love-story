D: Roger, were you a good girl today?

R: Papa! Roger isn't a LITTLE KID any more!

D: Haha, is that right? But... today is a special day, isn't it?

R: Papa, you remembered? Today is Roger's birthday!

D: Of course! Well! Your present is in this room. Do you wanna look for it?

R: Whaaa?! What could it be?

P: *Kyuun!*

B: *Wan wan!*

R: Bagel! Bagel! Kawwwwaiii!

R: Such big ears! Hehe, looks like you could fly through the air.

R: Papa! THANK YOU!!

M: Roger. A puppy is a living thing, so you must cherish him and raise him well, you know.

M: You must not get tired of him or neglect him!

D: That's right, and you must train him well.

R: Train?

D: That's right. To start, it'd be best to teach him "sit".

R: How do we do that?

D: Papa will show you, so watch closely.

D: Okay, Roger? So, tap here, on bagel's back... and say "Sit!"

D: Bagel...

D: Sit!

D: Bagel, Bagel!

D: Sit! Bagel, sit!

D: Good! Good! You're a very smart boy, Bagel! You get it now?

B: *Wan wan!*

D: Gooood! Good boy, good boy!

D: So, Roger. Please try it like Papa showed you.

R: Okay!

R: .....BAGEL!! BALL! GET THE BALL!

B: *whimper*

D: Roger... Roger, you're getting a little frustrated, aren't you?

R: ?!

D: Bagel has a heart, you know. Since Bagel won't do what you want, you got a little frustrated, right? Bagel is very sensitive. He can understand your body language... and he won't come to you if you're irritated.

M: Right. So if Bagel fetches even once, maybe you should lavish him with praise! That would make him happy, very happy. If you do that, Bagel might bring you the ball to get that praise again!

R: Ohhhh..... OK, I got it! I won't get frustrated! I'll praise him a bunch!... Right?

R: Let's try it!

R: *Wan?*

R: Yes! Bring that ball!

R: *hehe*

R: Nooo, Bagel. Hm, he doesn't get it...

R: Look, Bagel. There. That ball.

B: *Wan wan! Wan wan!*

R: .....!!

B: *almoooost*

D: Look, Bagel! Over to Roger!

R: Bagel, bring me that ball like a good boy! Bagel!

B: *Wan!*

R: Bagel! Bring it. Bring it here!

B: *Fetches like a champ*

R: Bagel..... YOU DID IT! YOU FETCHED!

R: Bagel! Wonderful! Wonderful! Bagel is a very good boy!

R: Papa, Mama, Bagel finally learned how to fetch!

M: Yes, very good, Roger!

D: I think Bagel might have understood your heart, Roger.

B: *Wan wan!*

M: Sleep is very important for a puppy, isn't it? It would be very very bad for him to get sick. So! Let's put him to bed, shall we?

R: Haaaai.

D: Tomorrow you can play with the ball, Roger.

R: That's right! Good night, Bagel!

## At home

D: So, since today is Sunday, wouldn't it be nice to go play ball with bagel in the park!

R: Yeah! Let's go! Bagel!!

B: *Wan! Wan!*

R: Be back sooooon!

M: Take care!

## At the park

R: Good, Bagel!
