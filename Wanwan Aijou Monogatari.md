Papa: Barley. (Yes/No)

Momo: Barley, your name is Barley. Got it?

Barley: *Wan wan!*

Momo: Barley! Barley! Kawwwwaiii!

Momo: Such big ears! Hehe, looks like you could fly through the air.

Momo: Papa! THANK YOU!!

Mama: Momo. A puppy is a living thing, so you must cherish him and raise him well, you know.

Mama: You must not get tired of him or neglect him!

Papa: That's right, and you must train him well.

Momo: Train?

Papa: That's right. To start, it'd be best to teach him "sit".

Momo: How do we do that?

Papa: Papa will show you, so watch closely.

Papa: Okay, Momo? So, tap here, on Barley's back... and say "Sit!"

Papa: Barley...

Papa: Sit!

Papa: Barley, Barley!

Papa: Sit! Barley, sit!

Papa: Good! Good! You're a very smart boy, Barley! You get it now?

Barley: *Wan wan!*

Papa: Gooood! Good boy, good boy!

Papa: So, Momo. Please try it like Papa showed you.

Momo: Okay!

- 👉Teach "sit"

Momo: Barley!

Momo: Sit!

Momo: Barley, sit!

Barley: .....

Momo: Barley! Sit!

Barley: ??? *Wan wan!*

Momo: Papaaaa.... Barley won't sit...

Papa: Goooood! Well! Next up is "fetch!"

Papa: Watch closely how Papa does this.

Papa: Barley!

Barley: *Wan!*

Papa: Barley. See the ball over there?

Barley: *Wan wan!*

Papa: Momo, show Barley the ball there.

Momo: OK!

Momo: Barley!

Barley: *Yawn*

- 👉Teach "fetch" 
- Quit teaching

Momo: .....Barley!! BALL! GET THE BALL!

Barley: *whimper*

Papa: Momo... Momo, you're getting a little frustrated, aren't you?

Momo: ?!

Papa: Barley has a heart, you know. Since Barley won't do what you want, you got a little frustrated, right? Barley is very sensitive. He can understand your body language... and he won't come to you if you're irritated.

Mama: Right. So if Barley fetches even once, maybe you should lavish him with praise! That would make him happy, very happy. If you do that, Barley might bring you the ball to get that praise again!

Momo: Ohhhh..... OK, I got it! I won't get frustrated! I'll praise him a bunch!... Right?

Momo: Let's try it!

- 👉Teach "fetch" 
- Quit teaching

Momo: Barley. Bring me the ball! Ball. The ball!

Barley: *Wan wan!*

- 👉Teach "fetch" 
- Quit teaching

Barley: *Wan!*

Momo: Look, Barley. Over there. Bring me that ball.

Momo: *Wan?*

Momo: Yes! Bring that ball!

Momo: *hehe*

Momo: Nooo, Barley. Hm, he doesn't get it...

Momo: Look, Barley. There. That ball.

Barley: *Wan wan! Wan wan!*

Momo: .....!!

Barley: *almoooost*

Papa: Look, Barley! Over to Momo!

Momo: Barley, bring me that ball like a good boy! Barley!

Barley: *Wan!*

Momo: Barley! Bring it. Bring it here!

Barley: *Fetches like a champ*

Momo: Barley..... YOU DID IT! YOU FETCHED!

Momo: Barley! Wonderful! Wonderful! Barley is a very good boy!

Momo: Papa, Mama, Barley finally learned how to fetch!

Mama: Yes, very good, Momo!

Papa: I think Barley might have understood your heart, Momo.

Barley: *Wan wan!*

Mama: Sleep is very important for a puppy, isn't it? It would be very very bad for him to get sick. So! Let's put him to bed, shall we?

Momo: Haaaai.

Papa: Tomorrow you can play with the ball, Momo.

Momo: That's right! Good night, Barley!

## At home

Papa: It's Sunday today, so it'd be nice to go to the park and play ball with Barley.

Momo: Yeah! Let's go! Barley!!

Barley: *Wan! Wan!*

Momo: Be back sooooon!

Mama: Take care!

## At the park

Momo: Good, Barley! Can you fetch this? Here we go!

- 👉Throw gently
- Throw hard

Momo: Here goes!

Momo: Barley, amazing! You learned how to fetch perfectly!

Momo: Here comes one more!

- Throw gently
- 👉Throw hard

Momo: There!

Barley: *Epic jump catch*

Momo: Awesome, Barley! How come you can do that, I never taught you!

Momo: Here comes one more!

- Throw gently
- 👉Throw hard

Barley: *Wan wan!*

Momo: Okaaay, this next one is gonna be hard, think you can do it?

Momo: Okay, here we go, Barley! THERE!

Barley: *Jumps into bush*

Momo: Barley, you there?

Momo: ....Barleyyy?

Momo: Barley, Barley! Come! Come back!

Momo: Barleyyy. (While calling out Barley's name, I got hungry all of a sudden...)

Momo: Barleyyy.... What happened...?

Barley: *Jumps out with a definitely not creepy doll*

Momo: Barley!

Momo: What were you doinnng? I was worrrieedd!

Momo: Wh, what's that? You picked up something other than the ball...

Barley: *Wan!*

Momo: That... That doll, where do I...?

Momo: Oh... Long ago, when we had to move here...

Momo: Umm, hmmm...

Momo: It was really important, so why can't I remember...

Momo: Judy... That's it! This is Judy!!!

Barley: *Wan wan!*

Judy: *JUMPS TO LIFE TERRIFYINGLY*

Judy: YOU REMEMBERED ME, MOMO-CHAN!!!

Momo: Eh? Eh?? EEHHHH???

Judy: Momo-chan! Momoland... it's-

Judy: Quick, quick! It's in danger... it's in danger...

Clock: *A mustachioed alarm clock jumps out of the bush, because why not*

Clock: Aaahhhhhh, aaah, ahem! Greetings!

Momo: W-wh-why!?? This.... alarm clock... is... moving?!

Judy: Shut up!! As I was saying, MOMOLAND IS IN PERIL!

Judy: SO, Momo-chan, we've gotta go back to Momoland!

Momo: Eh? EEEEEHHH?? What are you saying?!

Momo: I don't understand!

Clock: Ahem! Ahem!

Clock: For a subject of Momoland, you are acting most deplorable, Judy.

Clock: As the caretaker of the Door of Time, I must beg your forgiveness for coming to the World of Reality at my own regrettable pace.

Clock: Yes, I have returned, I have returned!

Judy: Ugh, I have to put up with this? Will you be quiet, old man!?

Clock: Hmf...

Clock: Ahem! You may call me Clock!

Clock: As I was saying, I am the keeper of the Door of Time, that connects Momoland and the World of Reality.

Clock: By the way, Momo-chan, it is almost time to go to JUKU.

Judy: Ugh! Enough about Juku, who cares!

Judy: Please, Momo-chan, there's no time. Look at this!

Momo: That's... Whose photo album is that?

Momo: .....That's my album!

Momo: How? Why?!

*A photo straight up disappears as you watch*

Momo: EEEH? The photo, it.... vanished!

Judy: Do you see why Momoland is so important now?

Judy: If things keep going this way, Momo-chan's memories will ALL BE GONE!

Judy: If I was just a little bit later, even your memory of me might have died...

Clock: Judy, the closing of the Door of Time will soon be upon us! Let us return!

Judy: Please, Momo-chan! Please don't forget about me!

Judy: We'll stay friends forever, right?

Momo: Of- Of course we're friends, Judy!

Momo: But, WHERE is Momoland?

Momo: So I have to go to "Juku" and...?

Clock: It is time, Judy! In 20 seconds... 19...

Momo: But I still have questions! ...And if I'm late for dinner, Papa will scold me...

Clock: 15... 14... 13...

Momo: Umm.... l- look, even if we were to go to Momoland, don't we need to prepare?

Momo: You know, like, things we need to bring, and... making arrangements...

Clock: 10... Judy, there's no time!

Clock: 8... Do you want to be stuck here!? 7...

Judy: Momo-chan! It's like I said... so... let's go!

Judy: I can explain better after we get there!

Momo: Eeehh! Judy!!!

*Everyone jumps back into the bushes*

Momo: Mr. Clock!

Barley: *Wan!* *Jumps in the bushes*

Momo: Ah... Barley! Oh... wait for meeeeeeeeee!

## Forest

Voice: -chan...

Voice: Momo-chan... Momo-chan...

Momo: *Waking up* Mama? What time is it?

Barley: *lick*

Momo: Kya! Barley... Where am i?

Clock: Momo-chan, this is Momoland.

Momo: Mr. Clock... Judy...!

Momo: We really came to... the land of memories...

Judy: Is Momo-chan going to be okay?

Clock: As we were not able to get to Juku in time, we are in a predicament...

Judy: Of course we're in a "predicament"!

Clock: Not "of course", Judy. Carelessly allowing so much time to elapse is a serious matter!

Judy: UGHHH! To begin with, won't you shut up with your "time", "time", "time"!

Judy: Don't tell me you've never been just a teeny, tiny, little bit late yourself!

Clock: Never.

Clock: I have periodic maintenance once every two months, without fail. Therefore, I am never late, not even a single second.

Momo: ... I guess we're here now... We gotta do what we gotta do...

Momo: So, Judy, what should I do here?

Judy: To tell the truth, Veggies have been stirring up a rebellion here in Momoland. It's like, a big pain for everyone!

Judy: Even Judy's favorite ribbon was taken...

Judy: The disappearance of Momo-chan's memories is also their doing.

Momo: But why would... vegetables... do that kind of thing?

*Cue dramatic music*

Judy: It's the "Dark Lord Cabbage"! He's their super evil leader!

Judy: He's the one ordering the Veggies around.

Momo: Dark Lord Cabbage?

Judy: The way I heard it, Dark Lord Cabbage is gradually eating your memories...

Judy: Momo-chan, it seemed like even your memories of me would be forgotten!!!

Momo: Dark Lord Cabbage...

Momo: So unless I defeat this guy, my cherished memories will vanish, huh?

Clock: Ahem. Momo-chan. It seems we have dragged you along and gotten you involved in this turmoil, but as a citizen of the World of Reality, walking about Momoland is simply unacceptable.

Clock: So! I have made arrangements for your return.

Momo: Eh! I can return?

Clock: Naturally, as long as you are together with I, the Keeper of the Door of Time, you may open the door and return home at any time. So let us return!

Judy: Mr. Clock, this is a serious affair, you said so yourself!

Clock: Silence!

Clock: Her presence is strictly prohibited by the 11th article of the Principles of Door Management!

Judy: Why you! This Momoland we're in is the world of Momo's memories, you know.

Clock: So, what are you saying?

Judy: You don't get it yet? All that tick-tocking must have liquefied your brain.

Judy: If this keeps going, and all Momo-chan's memories are taken away; if she turns into an adult with no memories of her childhood, the World of Reality and the World of Memories will be completely severed and set adrift!

Judy: If that happens, you're out of a job! The Door of Time becomes totally obsolete!

Judy: And if nobody needs the Door of Time, nobody needs the *Janitor* of the Door of Time, do they now?!

Clock: Wh- What? Me, become useless?

Clock: That IS a serious affair. I see no helping it, I shall grant you special permission.

Clock: However, I shall accompany you, performing the duty of official overseer.

Clock: Well then, let us briskly and without sluggishness return these memories.

Momo: But... how?

Barley: *Wan wan!*

Clock: UWAAAAAAAAAAAAH! DOG!! HERE!!! REMAIN CALM!

Momo: Barley, what is it?

Momo: Could Barley have found something that could be a clue?

Judy: If so, he may be small, but he's certainly a very helpful dog!

Momo: Barley, it's all you!

Barley: *Wan wan!*

## Tree

Momo: Huff huff... Barley.... huff... is there something... huff... about this tree?

Barley: *Wan wan!*

Voice: Ahhhhh, help meee!

Momo: Was that someone's... voice?

Judy: That voice...

Earb: Someone helllp meeee!

Earb: Ahhh, won't someone return my ear-mon!

Cukeman: Cyu-cyu-cyu-cyuke!

Cukeman: If you want it back so bad, why dont'cha come on down from da tree and get it? Haw haw!

Earb: Ohhh...

Cukeman: Cyu-cyu-cyuke! Haw haw! What's wrong? Come on dowwwwn!

Earb: I'M SCARED! Someone help meeeeee!

Clock: Why, that bear is...

Momo: It must be... Ummm... I can't remember.

Momo: But it's familiar... Ummm, umm, a bear...

Judy: Momo-chan, you can do it! Think back!

Momo: Errr... That's right! Earb the bear!! It's Earb!

Cukeman: Cyu cyuke, what's dis, youse some kinda friends of Prince Bear over there?

Momo: I am! We are friends!

Judy: You cucumbers all are just minions of the Dark Lord Cabbage, aren't you?

Judy: Stop picking on defenseless people!

Barley: *grrrr*

Cukeman: Cyu-cyu-cyuke. Well, what are you gonna do about it, hmm?

Cukeman: Youse! You wanna start something with me, Cukeman??!

Cukeman: I'll scrub your cucumberbumps clean off yas!

Barley: *Jumps into hole in tree* 

Barley: *Emerges from another hole*

Clock: Ah, Barley! I see, the holes must be connected.

Cukeman: O-ho! Prince Pup's come out to play, cuke.

Barley: *grrr, wan!*

Cukeman: Oi, Prince Puppy. One thing about us cukes is we loooooooooooove riddles-cuke.

Cukeman: IF you can answer our riddles, we'll letcha go on your way-cuke!

Cukeman: Think you can answer 'em, Prince Pup?!

Momo: Eeeeeeeh!


Shall we go over the rules?

* 👉Yes! explain
* I know, I'm good

Momo-chan. Since Barley can't really be expected to know riddles, you'll give him the answers. The rules arEarb: after Cukeman's riddle, three choices appear. Use the arrow buttons to choose the right one, and the A button to answer.

*Example plays out*

Momo: Barley, number two!

Barley: *barks twice!*

Think carefully before you answer, Momo-chan.

Cukeman: Cuke?! CUKE!! Impossibleeeeeeeeee!!! *falls off tree*

Momo: Do you give up?!

Barley: *wan!*

Cukeman: Cuke... it's over... we lost-cuke.

Cukeman: We lost to... lost to a.. a Prince Pup...

Cukeman: Shoot. You'll regret dis!

Earb: You brought my ear back!

Barley: *wanwan!*

Earb: Thank you!

Momo: Barley, this is Earb.

Barley: *wan!*

Momo: Earb might be a little bit of a crybaby, but he's a very, very sweet bear.

Momo: When I was a little girl, I was afraid of thunder, and I'd cling to Earb.

Momo: Ever since then, Earb has always been by my side, absorbing all my fears.

Momo: How could anyone bully such a sweet bear?

Earb: I, I dunno-mon.

Earb: I was just playing at home when the Dark Lord Cabbage and his Cyukemon came...

Earb: *sniffle* My ear... they... tore it up-mon...

Judy: That's horrible!!

Momo: So, you were waiting all this time for us to come?

Earb: That's right-mon.

Earb: Even though I'm afraid of heights, I had to wait it out up in that tree-mon.

Judy: Ah! Wait, is that... possibly... a doghouse?

Momo: I, I recognize that! That's... that's... that's right!

Momo: Captain! Captain's doghouse!

Momo: Barley, when I was little, looong before you came to our house, a dog named Captain lived with us.

Momo: He was also much, muuuch bigger than you.

Momo: Earb, is Captain in this world too!?

Earb: He lives with an old man in a forest wayyyyyyyyyy out there, way beyond that mountain-mon.

Momo: Old man... it couldn't be... grandpa?

Momo: My grandpa... who passed away?!

Earb: That's right-mon.

Momo: I can... I can meet my grandpa again!!

Momo: Earb, how do we get to that forest where grandpa is living?

[小一山]
Earb: I... don't know.... But I heard it's on the other side of that huge mountain, Mt. Elementary.

Clock: But... crossing Mt. Elementary........ that's impossible!

Judy: Momo-chan, Mt. Elementary is a verrry tall mountain! There's no way we can hike over it.

Judy: Right? *points to map*

Momo: Oh... well, what should we do...

Earb: It might be best if you take Momo Unit 01.

Earb: Momo Unit 01 can fly through the air!

Momo: Momo Unit 01?

Momo: My tricycle, Momo Unit 01?!

Momo: Talking about Momo-1... I, I remember! Back in kindergarten, I left it in the sandbox and came back home without it!

Clock: All too common an occurrence among young children, I am afraid. Regrettable, regrettable...

Momo: Sure, it was important to me, but... but FLYING with Momo-1...

Momo: Earb, where is Momo Unit 01?

Earb: Since this is the land of memories, Momo-1 should be in the place from your memories: "Kindergarten"-mon. Unfortunately, since Kindergarten was claimed by the Potato Bonbons as part of their territory, they may have made it into farmland-mon.

Momo: Which way is Kindergarten?

Judy: This way, Momo-chan!

Clock: I despise Kindergarten! For starters, the little grains of sand in the sandboxes always get in my gears...

Judy: Shut up, old man!

Barley: *wan wan!*

Momo: Well, what are we waiting for, guys?

## Field

Momo: Momo-1! Excuse me, I'm sorry, but I just accidentally left something around here, and, I've come back to get it now, so...

Unit 01: Momo-chan, you shouldn't have come here-wak! This is the Potato Bonbons' turf. One wrong step in this potato field, and you'll get blown to smithereens by a potatobomb-wak!

Bonbon: Heyyyy, what's up, losers! Time's a-wasting-bon! Heh heh hehhhh, you're gonna get it, pig-butts. The way back is right over here, bahahahhaa!

Clock: They are correct, there is no time! We simply do not have time to face off against these nincompoops! Now which of you wants to be saved by this Clock!?

Momo: Ah! Wait, Mr. Clock!

Clock: *Steps on bomb, explodes*

Momo: Mr. Clock!

Bonbon: Bahahahahaaaaa! You got it good-bonbon! You dingleberries are stuck with us now, bahahabahaaaaa! Say, who wants to challenge us next-bon? Momochaaan?

Momo: What do we do now...

Barley: *wan wan!*

Momo: .... What, Barley?

Barley: *wan wan!*

Momo: Barley, what are you trying to say?

Barley: *wan wan wan!*

Judy: Could Barley be saying that he can sniff out the bombs?

Earb: That's right-mon! Barley is saying exactly that!

Momo: Barley, we're counting on you. Guide us to Momo-1 safely, please!

Barley: *wan!*

## Potatomaze

Shall we explain how to play?

* 👉Yes! explain
* I know, I'm good

Barley is able to find the potatobombs by smell. Move Barley to Momo-1 without making him step on any bombs. Use the D-pad to move Barley. If there are any bombs, Barley will find them on his own. If you step on any, they'll explode, so be careful.

[Notes: There are also holes to investigate. Walking over a hole will not cause you to fall or anything.]

### Uncovering a mole

Momo: Ah! A mole! Kawaiiiiii!

Bonbon: Heeeeeeeee!! I hate moles! HAAATE MOLLEEESSSS-BONNNN!!

Momo: Eeeehhh, what? But it's so cute....

*Mole kicks the ass of the bonbon*

### The second time

Momo: Yes! Thank you, Mr. Mole!

### Reaching Momo-1

Momo: Yatttaaaaaa! Awesome, Barley!!!

Momo: I'm sorry, Momo-1, for leaving you...

Unit 01: It's all right, Momo-chan. Thank you for saving me!

Bonbon: Damn! Damn! No fair borrowing Prince Pup's powers, that's cheating!

Momo: Barley one of us, there's nothing "unfair" about it! He's our friend!

Bonbon: You're friends with a dog? That's messed up-bon. Help me out here, bro.

Bonbon: Sure, bro. That Prince Wan is nothing but a sad, pathetic mutt-bon.

[Ouyo. Wan-kou wa shimobe[boku]-da, iyashii[vulgur] aware[pity] na inu-kkoro da]

Earb: That's h-horrible...

Momo: You guys! What do you think you're saying?!

Bonbon: He's just telling it like it is-bon.

Momo: ENOUGH!!! Barley is our very, very dear friend!

Momo: *kicks bonbons into space*

Bonbon: Shiiiiiii- We won't forget this-bonnnnnnnnnn....

Momo: Barley, you ARE our best friend.

Judy: Momo-chan! Which of us is your best friend, me or Barley!?

Momo: Eh? Eh?

Judy: Which is your best friend!? You have to pick!

Momo: Which is best? You can't be compared like that.

Judy: No way, no way!! You and me have been together SO much longer than Barley!

Momo: Judy....

Earb: Judy, stop being jealous-mon.

Judy: Hey!

Earb: More importantly, Momo-chan, without Mr. Clock, you can't go back home-mon... what are you going to do?

Momo: Yeah...... But my grandpa is somewhere in this world, right? Grandpa's hobby was tinkering with mechanical stuff! I think he could definitely fix Mr. Clock for us!

Momo: What is it, Barley? There's no more bombs, you don't have to keep sniffing for them.

Barley: *digs* *wan wan!*

Earb: I wonder if he's saying there's something here?

Judy: Kyaaah! A bomb?!

Momo: Eeee!!!

Judy: What? Is that a backpack?

Momo: Ah... this backpack...!

Unit 01: That's right, it's the backpack you used in Kindergarten.

Momo: But, the shoulder strap broke, and I couldn't use it any more. Ahh, that's right... when I put something in it I'd call it my magic bag...

Earb: Well, then this is a REAL magic bag-mon! The things you believed in are all true here, you see-mon?

Momo: For real? It's really a magic bag??

Momo: Whaaa, cool! I can even put it in my pocket like this! I'll carry you, Mr. clock.

Momo: *puts clock in the bag*

Unit 01: Anyway, Momo-chan, are you ready to cross over Mt. Elementary-wak?

Momo: Momo-1, can you really fly?

Unit 01: Of course I can-wak! You said so every time you sat on my back-wak! "Take to the sky, Momo-1!" you'd say.

Momo: That's right, I had completely forgotten...

Unit 01: When you forgot, that was the moment I stopped being able to fly...wak... And that's how the potato guys managed to capture me...

Momo: Oh... I'm sorry.

Unit 01: But I'm okay now! You remembered, so now I can fly freely-wak!

Momo: All right, everyone! Let's go find Grandpa! On Momo Unit 01!

Momo: Oh, what should we do about Barley?

Barley: *wan wan!*

Momo: Is there any way... in this world, could Barley fly, I wonder?

Unit 01: It's okay-wak, Momo-chan. As long as he's by me, with those big ears, he can surely fly!

*UNIT 01 TRANSFORM!*

Momo: Whaaa! This is incredible! Barley, you really can fly!

Barley: *wan wan!*

Momo: Barley, I wonder why you can't talk like everyone else?

Judy: It's gotta be because Barley isn't your REAL friend yet. You've been talking to ME for 10 years already!

Momo: Ugh, enough, Judy! Change up your attitude or you're gonna get a tickling!

Judy: Poop.

Momo: But, it would sure be nice if you could talk like everyone else, Barley.

Barley: *whimper*

Judy: Hey, how'd you like to get a better look at the scenery?

Earb: Stooop. It's scary-mon...

Judy: Lookie, lookie!

Earb: Stopitstopitstopit-mon! Quit it, Judyyyy, quit itttt!

Momo: HEY! JUDY! It's tickle time!

Judy: Kyaaa, Momo-chan, forgive me! Don't tickle- ahahahahahahaha!

Judy: You know I can't t- take ithahaha! I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

Momo: Say you're going to change your attitude, say it!

Judy: Kyahaha, I promise! Nyahaha, forgive me, Momo-chan! Heehee!

Unit 01: Wak wak! Momo-chan, we crossed over Mt. Elementary-wak!

Momo: Yatta!

Momo: Let's fly just like this to the forest where Grandpa is!

Momo: Don't worry, Mr. Clock, if anyone can fix you, it's Grandpa!

Judy: Wait a second!! Momo-chan!! Before we get to the forest, isn't there... Lemon Hill...?

Momo: Oh, okay.... is something wrong with that?

Earb: It's terrible! That's where the Miracle Lemons are!

Unit 01: Oh, Momo-chan, I'm no good with the Miracle Lemons... just ONE of their acid slice attacks and folks like me go rusty instantly-wak!

Momo: Why? So maybe we should just keep flying? After all, we just flew over a huge mountain!

Unit 01: There's crazy strong wind currents above Lemon Hill, we simply can't cross it by flying-wak!

Earb: I hate sour stuff-mon. It stings my eye-eyes-mon.

Judy: Lemon facials are to blame for this blotch on my skin! Those lemons are the only thing I can't stand!

Momo: I guess there's no alternative... let's go in for a landing.

# Lemon Hill

Momo: What should we do... Since you all have problems with the Lemons...

Momo: Looks like there's no other way, should Barley and I go ahead?

Judy: Nonono! Judy will go too! We can't get separated!

Earb: Judy, don't be selfish-mon.

Unit 01: Quaaaack! Momo-chan, the backpack! The magic bag-wak!

Momo: Eh?? You mean the backpack Barley just dug up?

Unit 01: Quack-quack-that's-right. Everyone, we can go in there together-wak!

Momo: Even when the backpack is this small?

*It reverts to normal size*

Momo: Ah!!

Unit 01: Wak! All right everyone!

Unit 01: We hop inside, and Momo-chan can bring us along-wak.

Momo: About that... how exactly will everyone fit inside this bag...

*Poof*

Momo: You guys?... Could they really be in the bag?

Judy: I'm sorry I can't help...

Unit 01: Wak... Momo-chan, sorry I can't be of service...

Unit 01: But we'll be cheering you on, wak wak!

Earb: I think the Lemons will definitely know where your Grandpa lives. Momochan, good luck!

*The backpack shrinks down*

Momo: Well, Barley, it's down to just you and me now...

Barley: *wan! wan! wan!*

Momo: Thanks for the encouragement! Okay, Barley, let's do this!

## Lemon Hill Crossroads

Momo: We've arrived...

Barley: *whimper*

Momo: I've got a bad feeling about this place, somehow...

Voice: YOU TWO!

Lemon: What on earth are YOU doing hereeeeeeee?

Momo: We're trying to meet up with my grandpa, so we're crossing through.

Lemon: HO-ho-ho-ho-ho! No person shall pass, no matter who they beeeeee!

Momo: Look, I don't need a permission slip from you, we're crossing!

Lemon: Such libelous slander about us, we shall not toleraaaaateeeeee!

Lemon: You will NEVER be allowed to paaaaaaass!

Lemon: Even were you to try the impossible and pass, it would go a little something like thiiiiiiiiis!

Lemon: Give it to them, little sis!

Lemon: OK, sister!

Lemons: S-O-U-R-R-R-R-R-R-R!!!!!

Shall we explain how to play?

* 👉Yes! explain
* I know, I'm good

The Miracle Lemons are going to throw their *Souuuuuuuur Lemon Slice* at you. You can't let it hit you, so you must avoid contact with it. Press the D-pad down to duck, and up to... jump! Avoid contact with the lemon slices in this fashion. When the Lemons tire out, that's your chance to attack! Use the A button and hit them with a rock! Momochan, be careful of being hit by the Lemon Slice's sourness!

Lemon: I shall be your first opponent!

Lemon: Suuu-peeeer-soooourrr!

Lemon: *pant... pant...* Just... a little breather...

*after defeating little Miracle Lemon*

Lemon: Keeehhhhhh.... in-fu-ri-a-tinnnnnng. Big sis, h-e-l-p-m-e-eeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

Lemon: How dare you! My sister! I won't go easy on you... prepare yourself!

*after defeating big Miracle Lemon*

Lemon: Keeehhhhhh.... in-fu-ri-a-tinnnnnng. Maddening! Exasperating! Infuriatiiiiiing!

Momo: Yattaaaaa!!

Barley: *wan wan!*

Lemon: Kyuu...

Momo: Like I was saying, do you know where my grandpa lives? Tell me, and I'll help you out from under that pile of lemons.

Lemon: There is NOTHING that escapes our knowledge, is there, sis?

Lemon: Quite right, sister. There is not a thing we don't know.

Momo: Really!? Well then, WHERE is my Grandpa living!?

Lemon: I won't tell youuuuuuu!

Momo: Humph! I see, so that's your not-very-cute answer, then?

Lemon: Your threats are nothing! Nothing, nothing, nothinnnng!

Lemon: What you don't know is that we still have very, veeeeery powerful friends!

Lemon: Masterrr, Masterrr, we beg you!

Voice: As you called, here I am, your comrade!

Voice: Oh! Comrades! What on earth happened here?

Lemon: That girl BULLIED uuuuuuuuus!

Lemon: That's right. We were just playing when that girl and her little Prince Pup jumped us out of nowhere!

Lemon: I was scared, sooo sooo scared....

Voice: Hnnnnnnggg, you! To think this bad girl would cast such an evil eye upon my comrades!

Lemon: Master! You tell her, just like that! Tell her off!

Momo: Wait a minute, listen to me! It's the Lemons who arae the bad ones!

Momo: I was just trying to get to my Grandpa's house...

Voice: Silence! Don't give me excuses, is that how your mother taught you?

Voice: Huh! Wait!.... It's you....!!

Momo: Huh? What...?

Voice: Momo... Momo-chan!!

Momo: ....? How do you know my name?

Voice: It's me! Gunbot!

Lemon: M-master!?

Gunbot: This person is my second commander!

Lemon: WHAT!!! Wh- What in the?!

Gunbot: Attention, Lemons! I am categorically unable to defy my commander, for I am THE CONSUMMATE warrior. So! You will immediately relay the location of Momo-chan's grandfather!

Lemon: Uuuhh... but if we tell her, Dark Lord Cabbage is gonna yell at uuusss...

Gunbot: WHAT!! You two have been foot soldiers of Dark Lord Cabbage this whole time!?

Lemon: Sis! You've said too much, dummy!

Gunbot: YOU... You have been deceiving me all this time... Unforgivable! Those who resort to LIES can no longer be called comrades of mine!

Lemon: Uhhh-ha-ha-ha... Lying? Certainly, no, not us, preposterous!

Lemon: I- if you're looking for an old man, there's certainly an old man living at the foot of Lemon Hill!

Gunbot: How DARE the two of you try to turn me against my precious Momo-chan! How do you like THIS?!

Lemons: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah--

Gunbot: It's good to see you again, Momo-chan!

Momo: ... I'm so sorry... I still don't... remember you very well...

Gunbot: You don-... don't remember... me... Gunbot...

Momo: I'm sorry! I'm really sorry!

Momo: My memories are being ransacked right now by Dark Lord Cabbage!! So... there are still bits and pieces I don't remember!

Gunbot: ...

Momo: I'm sorry! But everyone has been lending me their strength so that we can defeat Dark Lord Cabbage.

Gunbot: Dark Lord Cabbage... he's been terrorizing everyone...

Gunbot: But... it's a shock... not being remembered by your second commander...

Momo: Um... second commander? If you told me a little more of that story, I might remember...

Gunbot: ... My first commander was a boy named Gun-chan.

Gunbot: Gun-chan bestowed on me the honor of the highest regard among all of his toys.

Momo: Gun-chan...? Umm.... Umm....

Gunbot: When you were going to move from your first house, Gun-chan gave me to you, his close friend, to remember him by... Since then, I've thought of you as my second commander, always...

Gunbot: Goodbye, Momo-chan...!!

Momo: Ah! Wait! Please, just wait a second!

Momo: Gun-chan... Gun-chan... Umm...

Momo: Ah!!! I remember now!!

Momo: Ahhhhhh, I'm such an idiot! How could I have forgotten the time I had with Gunbot! And caused him so much anguish...

Momo: What do I do... I'm sorry... Gunbot...

Barley: *wan!*

Momo: Yeah... At least we know the whereabouts of Grandpa now.

Momo: In any case, let's go to see Grandpa!

Barley: *wan! wan!*

## Grandpa's House

Momo: Could it really be grandpa's....

Earb: There might be Veggies there-mon...

Judy: We have to protect this peaceful forest from the Vegetable Corps! If we run into any, we'll drive 'em out just like that!

Momo: That's right.

Judy: Urk! Will you look at the state of that shack!?

Earb: Nooo, I'm scared-mon!

Gramps: Hello? Can I help you?

Momo: Grand... Grandpa?!

Gramps: Ohhh, is that you, Momo? It's good to see you.

Gramps: It's nice to see you, all of you.

Momo: Grandpa!!!

Gramps: You made it all this way. You must be tired.

## Interior

Momo: I never thought I'd be able to see you again, Grandpa...

Gramps: Whaat? But you can see me any time. Just reach for your memories of me, Momo, and there I'll be.

Gramps: But hey, kiddo. Take a look over here.

Captain: *wurf*

Momo: Captain! It's Captain!

Captain: Momo-chan! My sweet Momo-chan!

Captain: To believe that we meet again...!

Momo: You look happy, Captain! I'm so glad!

Momo: Ah, that's right!

Momo: Grandpa! Could you fix a clock?

Gramps: Of course! Why, is your clock broken, Momo?

Momo: Um... I'm not sure you can say that exactly...

Momo: Here it is, anyway...

Gramps: Oh dear! Wait, isn't that... Mr. Clock?

Momo: Grandpa, you know about Mr. Clock?

Gramps: Oh yes, I know him well. We met once every other month, like clockwork.

Judy: Oh! So it was you who did Mr. Clock's constant inspections!

Gramps: Ah, right you are. 

Gramps: His gatekeeper duties were one thing, that can't be helped. But Mr. Clock must have spent a lot of time thinking about how to get to you.

門番だったら仕方ないが、
について歩くのに、
あんまり時間にウルサイのも
考えもんだのう。

Gramps: I wonder if it might have driven him a little cuckoo sometimes.

Momo: Aha.

Gramps: That oughta've done it!

Momo: ?? Huh? Mr. Clock!

Gramps: ?? That's strange... He's only got the one winding key, did I forget to reattach it?

Momo: MR. CLOCK!

Clock: Nmm??? Y-----yaaaaaaaawn... I'm up...

Clock: I say, why is everybody staring at me?

Gramps: Mister, you were broken, and everyone was worried sick about you is why.

Barley: *wan!*

Gramps: Oh, well if you aren't a cute one. Momo, what's this little guy's name?

Momo: This is Barley! He's my new best friend!

Barley: *wan wan!*

Gramps: Ahh? So it's Barley?

Gramps: Look, I've got some cheese, do you like it?

Gramps: Haha! Is that good? Huh? One more? All right, all right.

Momo: Grandpa? Everyone else can talk, how come Barley is the only one who can't talk?

Gramps: Momo, words aren't the only way to understand someone's feelings, you know.

Gramps: Ohhh, really? I see.

Gramps: So you love cheese, Barley.

Momo: Could it... Can you understand Barley's words, Grandpa?

Gramps: Oh, I understand. But we aren't speaking with words, you know.

Gramps: It's communication of the heart. Captain's words, and Barley's words, this old heart can hear alllll of them. Isn't that right, Barley?

Barley: *wan!*

Gramps: "Cheese tastes good," he says, hoh!

Momo: Why? Why? I want so badly to communicate with Barley, why can't I seem to understand?

Gramps: Momo, you mustn't rush it.

Gramps: Try and listen closely to your heart.

Gramps: If you truly want to understand Barley, your heart must be open.

Gramps: Sloooowly, take your time.

Judy: Momo's grandpa! Listen, because of Dark Lord Cabbage, the World of Memories is in peril!

Earb: That's right-mon. Dark Lord Cabbage is erasing all the memories-mon!

Gramps: Is that so?... Well, I'd like to help... It's terrible, but, I'm afraid I can't...

Judy: WHY!?

Gramps: I have my own memories that I have to protect. You understand, Momo, don't you?

Momo: Uh-huh!

Gramps: But, I can give you this, Momo.

Momo: This is...?

Gramps: Have you forgotten already?

Gramps: Long ago, your Grandma gave you this as a Christmas present.

Momo: That's right... Papa said this bracelet can make three wishes come true!

Momo: But, when I found out Papa was Santa Claus, I thought that must have been made up too...

Gramps: Now do you think it could make your wishes come true?

Momo: Ummm... Now...

Judy: Hey, Momo-chan, wish to know where Dark Lord Cabbage is!

Momo: Yes, let's try it!

Momo: Tell me! Dark Lord Cabbage, WHERE is he?!

Gramps: Momo, in this world, there is nothing that can overcome Dark Lord Cabbage's magical powers.

Gramps: So, I'm sorry but the Flower Bracelet can't make that wish come true.

Momo: What! Then what's the point?

Gramps: Don't panic, don't panic, Momo. Don't you think there's another way to learn the location of Dark Lord Cabbage?

Unit 01: Quack! Momo-chan! I remember-wak!!!

Unit 01: The Potato Bonbons said something about the Hallo-Pumpkin knowing-wak.

Momo: Oh? So, let's start by looking for the Pumpkin!

Momo: Flower Bracelet, where is the Hallo-Pumpkin?!

Earb: Nooooo! Picture-Book Forest was so pretty, I can't believe it's gone black and white-mon!

Clock: Surely, this is the doing of Hallo-Pumpkin!

Judy: We've gotta beat that Pumpkin and save the picture books!

Clock: Picture-Book Forest is just beyond here, let us go!

Momo: Yeah, let's go!

Captain: Gramps... I... I...

Grampa: You don't have to worry about me, Captain.

Grampa: You want to help Momo?

Grampa: Yessir, you had best go with 'em.

Captain: *wufh!*

Momo: Captain.... You'll really come with us?

Momo: But... Captain, you're old, you really don't have to trouble yourself...

Captain: Momo-chan...　please take me with you.

Captain: I'll protect you, Momo-chan, now...

Captain: It's... it's my duty.

Momo: ...Thank you.

Momo: You were always by my side, Captain...

Momo: I'm truly happy...

Barley: *wan!*

Momo: ? What is it, Barley?

Barley: *wan! wan!*

Momo: Barley, what is it? Are you trying to tell us something?

Gramps: Momo, don't rely on words. Look closely at Barley. Clear your heart.

Momo: Yes.

Barley: Barley...

Barley: Barley will...

Barley: fight with

Barley: Momo-chan

Momo: Barley!! Thank you!

Grandpa: Momo...

Momo: ...?

Gramps: Please take good care of my friend who took care of me.

Gramps: And, be a good child, one who is kind and understands the hearts of everyone around her.

Momo: I will. Grandpa, will I get to meet you again?

Gramps: Of course. Just remember me, anytime, ok?

Gramps: Well, take good care, everyone. Good luck!

Momo: Okay! Here we gooooo!

Gramps: ...Please take care... Momo...
