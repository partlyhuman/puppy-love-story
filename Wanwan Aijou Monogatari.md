Papa: Haha, is that right? But... today is a special day, isn't it?

Momo: Papa, you remembered? Today is Momo's birthday!

Momo: Barley, your name is Barley. Got it?

Barley: *Wan wan!*

Momo: Barley! Barley! Kawwwwaiii!

Momo: Such big ears! Hehe, looks like you could fly through the air.

Momo: Papa! THANK YOU!!

Mama: Momo. A puppy is a living thing, so you must cherish him and raise him well, you know.

Mama: You must not get tired of him or neglect him!

Papa: That's right, and you must train him well.

Momo: Train?

Papa: That's right. To start, it'd be best to teach him "sit".

Momo: How do we do that?

Papa: Papa will show you, so watch closely.

Papa: Okay, Momo? So, tap here, on Barley's back... and say "Sit!"

Papa: Barley...

Papa: Sit!

Papa: Barley, Barley!

Papa: Sit! Barley, sit!

Papa: Good! Good! You're a very smart boy, Barley! You get it now?

Barley: *Wan wan!*

Papa: Gooood! Good boy, good boy!

Papa: So, Momo. Please try it like Papa showed you.

Momo: Okay!

- 👉Teach "sit"

Momo: Barley!

Momo: Sit!

Momo: Barley, sit!

Barley: .....

Momo: Barley! Sit!

Barley: ??? *Wan wan!*

Momo: Papaaaa.... Barley won't sit...

Papa: Goooood! Well! Next up is "fetch!"

Papa: Watch closely how Papa does this.

Papa: Barley!

Barley: *Wan!*

Papa: Barley. See the ball over there?

Barley: *Wan wan!*

Papa: Momo, show Barley the ball there.

Momo: OK!

Momo: Barley!

Momo: Barley! Go get the ball! Please!

Barley: *Yawn*

- 👉Teach "fetch" 
- Quit teaching

Momo: .....Barley!! BALL! GET THE BALL!

Barley: *whimper*

Papa: Momo... Momo, you're getting a little frustrated, aren't you?

Momo: ?!

Papa: Barley has a heart, you know. Since Barley won't do what you want, you got a little frustrated, right? Barley is very sensitive. He can understand your body language... and he won't come to you if you're irritated.

Mama: Right. So if Barley fetches even once, maybe you should lavish him with praise! That would make him happy, very happy. If you do that, Barley might bring you the ball to get that praise again!

Momo: Ohhhh..... OK, I got it! I won't get frustrated! I'll praise him a bunch!... Right?

Momo: Let's try it!

- 👉Teach "fetch" 
- Quit teaching

Momo: Barley. Bring me the ball! Ball. The ball!

Barley: *Wan wan!*

- 👉Teach "fetch" 
- Quit teaching

Barley: *Wan!*

Momo: Look, Barley. Over there. Bring me that ball.

Momo: *Wan?*

Momo: Yes! Bring that ball!

Momo: *hehe*

Momo: Nooo, Barley. Hm, he doesn't get it...

Momo: Look, Barley. There. That ball.

Barley: *Wan wan! Wan wan!*

Momo: .....!!

Barley: *almoooost*

Papa: Look, Barley! Over to Momo!

Momo: Barley, bring me that ball like a good boy! Barley!

Barley: *Wan!*

Momo: Barley! Bring it. Bring it here!

Barley: *Fetches like a champ*

Momo: Barley..... YOU DID IT! YOU FETCHED!

Momo: Barley! Wonderful! Wonderful! Barley is a very good boy!

Momo: Papa, Mama, Barley finally learned how to fetch!

Mama: Yes, very good, Momo!

Papa: I think Barley might have understood your heart, Momo.

Barley: *Wan wan!*

Mama: Sleep is very important for a puppy, isn't it? It would be very very bad for him to get sick. So! Let's put him to bed, shall we?

Momo: Haaaai.

Papa: Tomorrow you can play with the ball, Momo.

Momo: That's right! Good night, Barley!

## At home

Papa: It's Sunday today, so it'd be nice to go to the park and play ball with Barley.

Momo: Yeah! Let's go! Barley!!

Barley: *Wan! Wan!*

Momo: Be back sooooon!

Mama: Take care!

## At the park

Momo: Good, Barley! Can you fetch this? Here we go!

- 👉Throw gently
- Throw hard

Momo: Here goes!

Momo: Barley, amazing! You learned how to fetch perfectly!

Momo: Here comes one more!

- Throw gently
- 👉Throw hard

Momo: There!

Barley: *Epic jump catch*

Momo: Awesome, Barley! How come you can do that, I never taught you!

Momo: Here comes one more!

- Throw gently
- 👉Throw hard

Barley: *Wan wan!*

Momo: Okaaay, this next one is gonna be hard, think you can do it?

Momo: Okay, here we go, Barley! THERE!

Barley: *Jumps into bush*

Momo: Barley, you there?

Momo: ....Barleyyy?

Momo: Barley, Barley! Come! Come back!

Momo: Barleyyy. (While calling out Barley's name, I got hungry all of a sudden...)

Momo: Barleyyy.... What happened...?

Barley: *Jumps out with a definitely not creepy doll*

Momo: Barley!

Momo: What were you doinnng? I was worrrieedd!

Momo: Wh, what's that? You picked up something other than the ball...

Barley: *Wan!*

Momo: That... That doll, where do I...?

Momo: Oh... Long ago, when we had to move here...

Momo: Umm, hmmm...

Momo: It was really important, so why can't I remember...

Momo: Judy... That's it! This is Judy!!!

Barley: *Wan wan!*

Judy: *JUMPS TO LIFE TERRIFYINGLY*

Judy: YOU REMEMBERED ME, MOMO-CHAN!!!

Momo: Eh? Eh?? EEHHHH???

Judy: Momo-chan! Momoland... it's-

Judy: Quick, quick! It's important... it's crucial...

Clock: *A mustachioed alarm clock jumps out of the bush, because why not*

Clock: Aaahhhhhh, aaah, ahem! Greetings!

Momo: W-wh-why!?? This.... alarm clock... is... moving?!

Judy: Shut up!! As I was saying, MOMOLAND IS ESSENTIAL!

Judy: SO, Momo-chan, we've gotta go back to Momoland!

Momo: Eh? EEEEEHHH?? What are you saying?!

Momo: I don't understand!

Clock: Ahem! Ahem!

Clock: For a subject of Momoland, you are acting most deplorable, Judy.

Clock: As the caretaker of the Door of Time, I must beg your forgiveness for coming to the World of Reality at my own regrettable pace.

Clock: Yes, I have returned, I have returned!

Judy: Ugh, I have to put up with this? Will you be quiet, old man!?

Clock: Hmf...

Clock: Ahem! You may call me Clock!

Clock: As I was saying, I am the keeper of the Door of Time, that connects Momoland and the World of Reality.

Clock: By the way, Momo-chan, it is almost time to go to JUKU.

Judy: Ugh! Enough about Juku, who cares!

Judy: Please, Momo-chan, there's no time. Look at this!

Momo: That's... Whose photo album is that?

Momo: .....That's my album!

Momo: How? Why?!

*A photo straight up disappears as you watch*

Momo: EEEH? The photo, it.... vanished!

Judy: Do you see why Momoland is so important now?

Judy: If things keep going this way, Momo-chan's memories will ALL BE GONE!

Judy: If I was just a little bit later, even your memory of me might have died...

Clock: Judy, the closing of the Door of Time will soon be upon us! Let us return!

Judy: Please, Momo-chan! Please don't forget about me!

Judy: We'll stay friends forever, right?

Momo: Of- Of course we're friends, Judy!

Momo: But, WHERE is Momoland?

Momo: So I have to go to "Juku" and...?

Clock: It is time, Judy! In 20 seconds... 19...

Momo: But I still have questions! ...And if I'm late for dinner, Papa will scold me...

Clock: 15... 14... 13...

Momo: Umm.... l- look, even if we were to go to Momoland, don't we need to prepare?

Momo: You know, like, things we need to bring, and... making arrangements...

Clock: 10... Judy, there's no time!

Clock: 8... Do you want to be stuck here!? 7...

Judy: Momo-chan! It's like I said... so... let's go!

Judy: I can explain better after we get there!

Momo: Eeehh! Judy!!!

*Everyone jumps back into the bushes*

Momo: Mr. Clock!

Barley: *Wan!* *Jumps in the bushes*

Momo: Ah... Barley! Oh... wait for meeeeeeeeee!

## Forest

Voice: -chan...

Voice: Momo-chan... Momo-chan...

Momo: *Waking up* Mama? What time is it?

Barley: *lick*

Momo: Kya! Barley... Where am i?

Clock: Momo-chan, this is Momoland.

Momo: Mr. Clock... Judy...!

Momo: We really came to... the land of memories...

Judy: Is Momo-chan going to be okay?

Clock: As we were not able to get to Juku in time, we are in a predicament...

Judy: Of course we're in a "predicament"!

Clock: Not "of course", Judy. Carelessly allowing so much time to elapse is a serious matter!

Judy: UGHHH! To begin with, won't you shut up with your "time", "time", "time"!

Judy: Don't tell me you've never been just a teeny, tiny, little bit late yourself!

Clock: Never.

Clock: I have periodic maintenance once every two months, without fail. Therefore, I am never late, not even a single second.

Momo: ... I guess we're here now... We gotta do what we gotta do...

Momo: So, Judy, what should I do here?

Judy: To tell the truth, Veggies have been stirring up a rebellion here in Momoland. It's like, a big pain for everyone!

Judy: Even Judy's favorite ribbon was taken...

Judy: The disappearance of Momo-chan's memories is also their doing.

Momo: But why would... vegetables... do that kind of thing?

*Cue dramatic music*

Judy: It's the "Dark Lord Cabbage"! He's their super evil leader!

Judy: He's the one ordering the Veggies around.

Momo: Dark Lord Cabbage?

Judy: The way I heard it, Dark Lord Cabbage is gradually eating your memories...

Judy: Momo-chan, it seemed like even your memories of me would be forgotten!!!

Momo: Dark Lord Cabbage...

Momo: So unless I defeat this guy, my cherished memories will vanish, huh?

Clock: Ahem. Momo-chan. It seems we have dragged you along and gotten you involved in this turmoil, but as a citizen of the World of Reality, walking about Momoland is simply unacceptable.

Clock: So! I have made arrangements for your return.

Momo: Eh! I can return?

Clock: Naturally, as long as you are together with I, the Keeper of the Door of Time, you may open the door and return home at any time. So let us return!

Judy: Mr. Clock, this is a serious affair, you said so yourself!

Clock: Silence!

Clock: Her presence is strictly prohibited by the 11th article of the Principles of Door Management!

Judy: Why you! This Momoland we're in is the world of Momo's memories, you know.

Clock: So, what are you saying?

Judy: You don't get it yet? All that tick-tocking must have liquefied your brain.

Judy: If this keeps going, and all Momo-chan's memories are taken away; if she turns into an adult with no memories of her childhood, the World of Reality and the World of Memories will be completely severed and set adrift!

Judy: If that happens, you're out of a job! The Door of Time becomes totally obsolete!

Judy: And if nobody needs the Door of Time, nobody needs the *Janitor* of the Door of Time, do they now?!

Clock: Wh- What? Me, become useless?

Clock: That IS a serious affair. I see no helping it, I shall grant you special permission.

Clock: However, I shall accompany you, performing the duty of official overseer.

Clock: Well then, let us briskly and without sluggishness return these memories.

Momo: But... how?

Barley: *Wan wan!*

Clock: UWAAAAAAAAAAAAH! DOG!! HERE!!! REMAIN CALM!

Momo: Barley, what is it?

Momo: Could Barley have found something that could be a clue?

Judy: If so, he may be small, but he's certainly a very helpful dog!

Momo: Barley, it's all you!

Barley: *Wan wan!*

## Tree

Momo: Huff huff... Barley.... huff... is there something... huff... about this tree?

Barley: *Wan wan!*

Voice: Ahhhhh, help meee!

Momo: Was that someone's... voice?

Judy: That voice...

Earb: Someone helllp meeee!

Earb: Ahhh, won't someone return my ear-mon!

Momo: But it's familiar... Ummm, umm, a bear...

Momo: Errr... That's right! Earb the bear!! It's Earb!

Cukeman: Cyu cyuke, what's dis, youse some kinda friends of Prince Bear over there?

Cukeman: Youse! You wanna start something with me, Cukeman??!

Cukeman: I'll scrub your cucumberbumps clean off yas!

Barley: *Jumps into hole in tree* 

Barley: *Emerges from another hole*

Clock: Ah, Barley! I see, the holes must be connected.

Cukeman: O-ho! Prince Pup's come out to play, cuke.

Barley: *grrr, wan!*

Cukeman: Oi, Prince Puppy. One thing about us cukes is we loooooooooooove riddles-cuke.

Cukeman: Think you can answer 'em, Prince Pup?!

Momo: Eeeeeeeh!


Shall we go over the rules?

*Example plays out*

Momo: Barley, number two!

Barley: *barks twice!*

Think carefully before you answer, Momo-chan.

Earb: You brought my ear back!

Barley: *wanwan!*

Earb: Thank you!

Momo: Barley, this is Earb.

Barley: *wan!*

Momo: Earb might be a little bit of a crybaby, but he's a very, very sweet bear.

Momo: When I was a little girl, I was afraid of thunder, and I'd cling to Earb.

Momo: Ever since then, Earb has always been by my side, absorbing all my fears.

Momo: How could anyone bully such a sweet bear?

Earb: I, I dunno-mon.

Earb: I was just playing at home when the Dark Lord Cabbage and his Cyukemon came...

Earb: *sniffle* My ear... they... tore it up-mon...

Judy: That's horrible!!

Momo: So, you were waiting all this time for us to come?

Earb: That's right-mon.

Earb: Even though I'm afraid of heights, I had to wait it out up in that tree-mon.

Judy: Ah! Wait, is that... possibly... a doghouse?

Momo: I, I recognize that! That's... that's... that's right!

Momo: Captain! Captain's doghouse!

Momo: Barley, when I was little, looong before you came to our house, a dog named Captain lived with us.

Momo: He was also much, muuuch bigger than you.

Momo: Earb, is Captain in this world too!?

Earb: He lives with an old man in a forest wayyyyyyyyyy out there, way beyond that mountain-mon.

Momo: Old man... it couldn't be... grandpa?

Momo: My grandpa... who passed away?!

Earb: That's right-mon.

Momo: I can... I can meet my grandpa again!!

Momo: Earb, how do we get to that forest where grandpa is living?

[小一山]
Earb: I... don't know.... But I heard it's on the other side of that huge mountain, Mt. Elementary.

Clock: But... crossing Mt. Elementary........ that's impossible!

Judy: Momo-chan, Mt. Elementary is a verrry tall mountain! There's no way we can hike over it.

Judy: Right? *points to map*

Momo: Oh... well, what should we do...

Earb: It might be best if you take Momo Unit 01.

Earb: Momo Unit 01 can fly through the air!

Momo: Momo Unit 01?

Momo: My tricycle, Momo Unit 01?!

Momo: Talking about Momo-1... I, I remember! Back in kindergarten, I left it in the sandbox and came back home without it!

Clock: All too common an occurrence among young children, I am afraid. Regrettable, regrettable...

Momo: Sure, it was important to me, but... but FLYING with Momo-1...

Momo: Earb, where is Momo Unit 01?

Earb: Since this is the land of memories, Momo-1 should be in the place you remember leaving it: "Kindergarten"-mon. Unfortunately, since Kindergarten was claimed by the Potato Bonbons as part of their territory, they may have made it into farmland-mon.

Momo: Which way is Kindergarten?

Judy: This way, Momo-chan!

Clock: I despise Kindergarten! For starters, the little grains of sand in the sandboxes always get in my gears...

Judy: Shut up, old man!

Barley: *wan wan!*

Momo: Well, what are we waiting for, guys?
