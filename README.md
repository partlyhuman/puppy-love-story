Puppy Love Story, or „Çè„Çì„Çè„ÇìÊÑõÊÉÖÁâ©Ë™û (Wanwan Aijou Monogatari), is a visual novel released in 1995 as a launch title for the Casio Loopy. The script was written by Kenji Terada, well known for his storied career including foundational work on the Final Fantasy series. It's aimed at a younger audience, centred around growing up without losing touch with your childhood.

## Getting it!

## Patching

The patch should be applied to `Wanwan Aijou Monogatari.bin`, a big-endian dump of the commercial cartridge:

* CRC32 `10c5f568`
* MD5 `fb86fc827b7fcd1fc457294523465377`
* SHA-1 `4a306e64f5e4743d943efb41c6deb2af4dd85974`
* SHA-256 `3ccdfd7db00110d6d13b23ca9eb2e8e448559055df2fa5356a80a5b1c00fcd72`

## Running

This was the only cartridge released for Loopy with expansion audio: samples are used for dog noises and other sound effects. The best way to get the full experience with expansion audio is using the [Loopy My Seal Emulator](https://github.com/partlyhuman/LoopyMSE/releases/). If you include the "pcm" folder full of numbered WAV files next to the ROM, MSE 0.4.0 or greater should recognize and use it.

You can also flash the game to your [Floopy Drive](https://github.com/partlyhuman/floopydrive) and play on a Loopy console. The expansion audio will not be heard, but the game is perfectly playable without it. You'll still get music and basic sound effects.
